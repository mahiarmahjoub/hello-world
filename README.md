# hello-world
A platform for improving my coding skills

I want to use this platform to write my future codes regarding computational biology.
I really want to come up with a new package to use artificial intelligence to analyse molecular and population genetics data. 
And maybe, make an educational app about it as well!

Peace Out :D
